# pf_challenge

Thank you for your interest in joining Portalform. This coding challenge is the
next step in our interview process. Start by watching the video below.

[![loom video](https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/3432eb6de50f4abf87fb737739dc6ef6-with-play.gif)](https://www.loom.com/share/3432eb6de50f4abf87fb737739dc6ef6 'Arc - felipap/pf-challenge: A toy version of Portalform to test your experience with Typescript, Node.js and programming. - 8 May 2023 - Watch Video')

## What is this? ü§î

This repo is a "toy" version of Portalform, with lots of missing parts. Your
challenge will be to implement one of these missing parts.

Our goal is to give you an authentic but scaled-down experience of working at
Portalform. Like our actual codebase, this repo has its fair share of
imperfections. You are free to modify anything you'd like.

## Pick your adventure üó∫Ô∏è

Choose _one_ of the following projects to work on:

- [Github Source](./docs/projects/GITHUB.md)
- [Postgres Destination](./docs/projects/POSTGRES.md) (not ready yet)

**Keep in mind**: These projects are intentionally open-ended, just like
projects in real life. There are no "right" answers (although there are probably
some wrong ones). We're looking for your thought process, your communication
skills, and your ability to ship code.

Feel free to reach out with any questions, or make assumptions and document them
in your PR. (Ask¬†yourself:¬†"What would I do as a Portalform developer?")

## Timing ‚è∞

We recommend spending around 4 hours on your project. Don't aim for perfection:
aim for an MVP that you would feel comfortable pushing to `main`.

Please submit your work within 5 days of receiving it. Let us know if you'll
need more time.

## Tips for Success üí°

Approach this challenge as you would a first task at Portalform.

For example:

- Feel free to Google, use Github Copilot, or any other tools you'd normally use
  as a developer.
- Ask questions and seek to unblock yourself.
- The codebase isn't perfect. You can suggest changes to files outside of the
  scope of your project.

## How to Submit Your Work üì¶

Open a PR with your suggested changes (or multiple PRs if you prefer). Remember
to include comments explaining your thought process and any tradeoffs you made.
You can showcase your work in a way that best reflects your style and strengths.

## Good luck üçÄ

We're excited to see what you build!
